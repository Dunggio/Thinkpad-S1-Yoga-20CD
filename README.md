# Thinkpad-S1-Yoga-20CD
Fullyworking Catalina Hackintosh with OpenCore. <br>
Following from guide of creating **[Laptop Haswell](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/haswell.html#starting-point)** with OpenCore 0.6 <br>

**[OpenCore.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/tree/itlwm)** replaced with branch support _immutablekernel_ which always contains IO80211Family.kext for Black80211.kext and itlwm.kext to run properly
