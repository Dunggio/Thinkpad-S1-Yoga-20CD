# Thinkpad-S1-Yoga-20CD
Fullyworking Catalina Hackintosh with OpenCore.
Following from guide of creating Laptop Haswell with OpenCore 0.6 (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/haswell.html#starting-point)
_OpenCore.efi_ replaced with branch support _immutablekernel_ which always contains IO80211Family.kext for Black80211.kext and itlwm.kext to run properly (https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/tree/itlwm)
